# RayCastingPythonMaze
A very simple 3D maze game made from scratch in python, using only three libraries:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Keyboard

Based on the Ray Casting technique, where the objects are drawn entirely out o vertical lines. The size and position of the lines is defined by the distance between the player and the object.
